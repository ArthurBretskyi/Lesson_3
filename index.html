        <p>
          <span>Queen</span> really reached for the stars with the production
          and release of their fourth album, A Night at the Opera in 1975. At
          the time it was the most expensive album ever recorded as it utilized
          extraordinary and methodical overdubs to achieve a rich orchestral and
          choral effects and incorporated rich replications of a wide range of
          styles. Many of these styles had not previously been adopted by hard
          rock bands, but the tremendous inventiveness and attention to details
          made this album the pinnacle of Queen’s career.
        </p>
        <p>
          The origins of queen date back to 1968, when guitarist
          <span>Brian May</span> and drummer <span>Roger Taylor</span> started
          the group, Smile, while students in London. A friend and follower of
          the band, <span>Farrokh Bulsara</span>, eventually joined the group in
          late 1970 and convinced the members to change the name to Queen
          because of its “regal” quality and his ability (as an art student) to
          design an adequate logo. After going through a number of bass players,
          John Deacon joined in 1971 as the permanent fourth member of the group
          which maintain this lineup for the next 20 years. Shortly after the
          release of their 1973 self-titled debut album, Bulsara officially
          adopted his stage name, <span>Freddie Mercury</span>. In 1974, the
          group released two critically acclaimed LPs, Queen II and Sheer Heart
          Attack, each of which spawned a Top 10 hit in the UK with Sheer Heart
          Attack being their first commercial success in the US.

          In early 1975, the band shopped for a better record deal, at first
          considering Led Zeppelin’s new Swan Song label before signing with A&M
          who gave the group a huge recording budget. A Night at the Opera was
          co-produced by <span>Roy Thomas Baker</span> and the individual band
          members who invented some of the distinctive techniques required to
          achieve the desired sounds and effects. The album borrowed its title
          from a popular 1935 Marx Brothers movie of the same name.

          The album begins with Freddie Mercury’s, “Death on Two Legs (Dedicated
          to…)”, at first coming in with a classical sounding piano and doomy
          sound effects, including a slight background scream. The song then
          breaks in as a steady rocker with an upfront lead by May and
          unambiguous lyrics of pure venom, adding an acid sensation to this
          otherwise enjoyable rock song. Mercury penned the tune about Queen’s
          ex-manager, Norman Sheffield, who had reportedly mistreated the band
          during their early years. As if to intentionally lighten the
          atmosphere after the opener, “Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon” follows as
          a light music hall piano track which, after a single minute, abruptly
          morphs into a hard rock bridge to Taylor’s “I’m in Love with My Car”.
          On this unique take on a classic analogy between a woman and an
          automobile, Taylor’s lead vocals work perfectly for the slow screed
          along with May’s raw guitar chords.

      <div id="friend" class="about-song">
        <p>
          “You’re My Best Friend” was written by John Deacon on a Wurlitzer
          electric piano and is the closest the group would come to a
          traditional seventies pop song. The song features stark but enjoyable
          production and overdubs with depth, contrasting with the upfront Wurli
          piano, and deep backing harmonies throughout. May adds some fine
          harmonized guitars late in the song, topping off this immensely
          entertaining track, which was a Top 10 hit. “’39” is another giant
          leap in musical diversity as a folk acoustic track with a simple stomp
          in the background and May taking lead vocals. The track has an aura of
          fantasy brought on by the operatic backing vocals, the slight
          synthesizer effects and the lyrical fantasy of time and space travel.
          The album’s first side ends with, perhaps, the two weakest tracks on A
          Night at the Opera. “Sweet Lady” is a bridge too far in trying to be
          original, with odd timings and creative riffs which, unfortunately, do
          not pay entertainment dividends. “Seaside Rendezvous” is another
          experimental music hall type song, which features vocalized renditions
          of different instruments, making it more of a musical accomplishment
          than a legitimate track on a rock album.

      <div id="prophet" class="about-song">
        <p>
          The second side begins with “The Prophet’s Song”, a theatrical epic by
          May with a dramatic, building theme and slightly psychedelic feel. The
          middle section features an orchestra made wholly of layered vocals
          with repetitive timing effects. When the music returns, May brings the
          rock track back with a layered guitar lead over choppy rhythms through
          a long outro with an acoustic solo instrumental at the very end.
          Mercury’s “Love of My Life” is a sad and simple song of lost love,
          which mainly features Mercury solo on piano with just some slight
          bass, backing harmonies, and a later distant but potent electric
          guitar lead by May. After a very slight intro guitar lead, May plays a
          solo ukulele while singing lead vocals on “Good Company”. This
          building track eventually incorporates some rhythm and further
          overdubbed guitars which recreate a Dixieland jazz arrangement.

      </a>

      <div id="rhapsody" class="about-song">
        <p>
          The masterpiece of the album is Mercury’s epic “Bohemian Rhapsody”, a
          song which he had developed in pieces dating back to the late 1960s.
          Starting with an a capella vocal harmony intro before making its way
          to the song proper with Mercury singing and playing piano, the song
          moves through several distinct phases and sonic dynamics, the most
          famous being the long middle, pseudo-opera section. This was
          accomplished through an elaborate choir effect created by Mercury, May
          and Taylor singing their specific vocal parts for hours on end, with
          over 180 separate overdubs mixed and sub-mixed onto the 24-track
          master tape, with the entire process taking about three weeks to
          complete. Still, with all of this bombast and tremendous production,
          it may be the quiet sections of the song, such as Mercury’s final solo
          vocal line with subtle guitar backing by May, that makes this song a
          true masterpiece. The album concludes with May’s instrumental of “God
          Save the Queen”, the British national anthem, which was originally
          recorded in 1974 as a homage to Jimi Hendrix’s version of “The
          Star-Spangled Banner”.
